# <h1 align="center"> FamilyHealthApp
<p align="center"> This project was based off and forked from FamilyHealthApp. I wanted to build a app to go with my fitness app but when I saw this I decided to rework it all from the begining. This time around instead fitness as the core, overall health and welness will be the basis. With the world the way it is why not design something to keep people reminded about their personal health?
